# The Sports Review

A Twitter/Quora of sorts for sports fans: It's a place where fans can come together and debate, prognosticate, speculate, release breaking news, or have educated discussions about issues and trends in sports. 
Its a place where fans can become the sports writers. Budding sports writers themselves can build a following here without the need for major networks or publications to provide a platform, further granting 
them the ability to build a resume, portfolio, and career. Bringing writers and readers together, fans can easily discover new content, discover and follow their favorite writers, and have a daily feed of new 
additions from their followed writers. It's everyone's individual sports blog blended together in one convenient platform.
