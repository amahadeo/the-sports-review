# The Sports Review

[https://thesportsreview.herokuapp.com](https://thesportsreview.herokuapp.com)

A Twitter/Quora of sorts for sports fans: It's a place where fans can come together and debate, prognosticate, speculate, release breaking news, or have educated discussions about issues and trends in sports. 
Its a place where fans can become the sports writers. Budding sports writers themselves can build a following here without the need for major networks or publications to provide a platform, further granting 
them the ability to build a resume, portfolio, and career.
